## Key Concepts Explained (page.tsx)

**Animation Strategy**: Uses `framer-motion` for staggered animations - each element appears with a slight delay to create a smooth, professional entrance effect.

**Responsive Design**: Extensive use of Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure the layout works across all device sizes.

**CSS Effects**:

- **Glassmorphism**: `backdrop-blur-xl` + semi-transparent backgrounds
- **Hover States**: `group` class enables child elements to respond to parent hover
- **Animations**: CSS transitions combined with Framer Motion for smooth interactions

**Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML with `<header>`, `<section>`, and appropriate link attributes (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`).

The component creates a modern landing page with smooth animations, responsive design, and interactive elements that guide users to important links.

## CSS Architecture (globals.css)

Here's your CSS file with detailed comments explaining each section:

**Key Points to Remember:**

- **CSS Custom Properties**: The `:root` variables create a centralized theme system that can be easily modified
- **Tailwind Layers**: The `@layer` directive ensures proper CSS specificity and organization
- **Brand Consistency**: Custom utilities maintain consistent use of brand colors across the app
- **Responsive Strategy**: Multiple breakpoints handle different device constraints (height, width, orientation)
- **Performance**: Using `rgba()` for opacity variations is more performant than multiple color definitions

This setup provides a solid foundation for a consistent, responsive design system!

## Layout Architecture (layout.tsx)

Here's your layout.tsx file with detailed comments explaining each part:

**Key Points to Remember:**

- **RootLayout wraps everything**: Every page in your Next.js app will be inside this layout
- **Metadata is automatic**: Next.js uses the exported metadata object for SEO
- **Children prop**: This is where your actual page content gets rendered
- **suppressHydrationWarning**: Prevents React warnings during server-side rendering
- **Global styles**: The globals.css import applies to your entire app

This is a solid foundation for a Next.js app with good SEO practices and mobile support!
